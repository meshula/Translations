3. Common Question: Is it worth moving to HDR?

yup.
It has to be done right to be attractive.

5. Let's have a look at HDR
6. What is an HDR TV?
7. The TV gets a single and converts it to light
Historically film was transmissive
LCD are transmissive
Moving forward, there'll be electroluminscent displays

8. SDR > HDR
High contrast high output screens are on the way
These displays require new encodings
HDR10, Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG), Dolby Vision, etc.

HDR - high dynamic range
SDR - standard dynamic range

9. nit is a measure of brightness.
1 nit = 1 cd/m^2

Typical SDR television white is 100 nits
HDR screens have brightnesses ranging from 1000 to 10,000 nits.
That's 100x brighter.

10. dynamic range
Black and white change
black brightness is referred to as B nit,
white brightness as W nit
Dynamic range is log (W/B)
It seems people can perceive a dynamic range of 12.

There isnt' a direct relationship between values in the signal and on the display.

12. Gamma

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/flgeimpisj

Transformation from signal to light
There's variation; sRGB, bt.709, bt.1886

13. sRGB
A power relation. Not quite what a TV displays. See the ITU-R spec for details

14. HDR Gamma

HDR10(PG) and HLG are two common functions.

15. We're not going to call them HDR Gamma, we're going to call then EOTF/OETF

Electro-optical transfer function, and Opto-electronic transfer function


17. HDR10 OETF

Perceptual quantizer curve, maps a 0 to 1 signal to 0, 10000 nits.

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/78yfr5z9yx

comparison to SDR gamma 2.4; 100 nits vs 10,000.
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/78yfr5z9yx

That's not going to work.

20. Comparison to SDR, the dynamic range of SDR is barely visible vs HDR.


21. HDR combines brightness and color.

SDR(sRGB) OETF: sRGB/Gamma, color Rec.709
HDR(HDR10) OETF: PQ, color Rec.2020

22. Color space

CEDEC 2016 had a presentation on coor science for games.

23. Rec.709 diagram and chromaticities
24. Rec.2020
25. Rec.2020 captures more of red blue and green.

27. There's a lot to know about TVs, right?

28. Transitioning from current methods to HDR
SDR First regime

GTSPORT HDR history
GTSport supported the first HDR TVs.
The feature was called "Scapes
There was a new photorealistic photo mode
These first assets did not have wide color gamut

30. Move to HDR
Manufacturers were like "we're making HDR displays, got any content for us?"
Of course we'll do that :)
We've got some work to do.

The model materials were Rec.709/SRGB, Scapes was.
Rendering was in Rec.709 linear and output to sRGB
All SRGB.

34. vivid HDR

Framebuffers were upgraded to HDR10. Rec.709 rendering could be moved to
Rec 2020 and output through a PQ curve.

this is vivid HDR.

35. This was our first result. It was very good; the screen was nice and bright,
we were surprised it could be done in real time.

37. Downsides
No improvement to color
Rec.709 kind of sucks
Colors are not very natural looking.

38/39/40 First renderings from 2015

41. Impetus for Native HDR
Car material spectral representtaion
Raw images are wider than 709
To get the pictures we want, a move to full HDR was desired.

42. Creating HDR first
43. Wide color gamut pipeline
What color space should lighting occur in?

- scRGB? CIE XYZ? Aces CG? Rec.2020?

scRGB has wide color and high dynamic range
scRGB hasn't got a well matched frame buffer format.

CIEXYZ is the widest gamut, easy to get from there to Rec.2020
The gamut is too wide.
The white point doesn't match HDR10's.
dang

46. The upper triangles show full spectral lighting, lower are XYZ.

47. ACES
Academy Color Encoding System.
The Reference Rendering Transform and Output Device Transform have a lot of magic
numbers.

48. Rec.2020
HDR10's color space is Rec.2020
Most HDR TVs can almost do this
Same white point as SRGB. 
Probably the best choice

49. Lead engineer's message. "Looks like bt2020 is it. Scary"

50. Merits and demerits of wide gamut
Car lighting and materials will look good
255, 0, 0 is still an extreme color

54. color temperature
sRGB color gamut is straight forward
Rec.2020 accomodates a color temperature from 2300K to 12000K
European night lighting is very orange
There's also areas without aritifical lighting

Demerits
Hard to get monitors that can display wide gamut
No HDR10 displays with full output
Hard for artists to verify, they have to rely on engineers to check things
Wide gamut files have to be made, the ability to make them is a risk

57. And what about wide gamut rendering
Different colors, and feeling.
The output is a lot like Camera RAW

58. What does Rec.2020 give us?

60-68 An image rendering correctly into Rec.709, an image rendered into 
Rec.2020 clips if directly moved to Rec.2020. Yellow's an issue. Also... Gamut
clipping on a naturalistic image. Rec.2020 colors clipped if dropped into 709.

69-76. As we increase brightness the gamut clips towards white. We need tone
mapping to bring colors back from white. What tonemap can resolve this?

77. We can make a curve like this.
78-79 We can clamp the brightness around here, making a smoother transition to
white.

80. John Hable (Naughty Dog) Filmic curve
Extremely shallow
Seems to be built for a 200nit display

81. AMD Filmic
Timothy Lottes, 2016
Adjutable peak
No linear section

82. ACES RRT+ODT
Magic numbers galore
Lots of people worked on it
A lot of parameters to tweak

83. Comparison
They all have a lot of parameters and aren't aimed at artistic control
The Naughty Dog curve is the only one an artist can really control

84/85. What do artists want?
- Control over a linear segment
- Contrast and black level
- smoothness of the curve

What can satisfy these three points?

86. Result, GT Tonemap, with a "triple section"
87. The toe controls the black contrast.
88. The mid section is linear
89. The shoulder is smooth
90. Put them together for the "triple section"
91. Play with it here: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/et1qmcg10s

92. GT Tonemap HDR image, showing linear and PQ tonemap
93. GT Tonemap HDR image, showing Rec2020 linear to sRGB mapping

94-104. How does it look

105-110. Hue Shift. 
RGB can be individually tone mapped
High precision control over color gradation
Example pictures

111-117. There is a camera simulator in game, but how does a real camera behave?
Real cameras also exhibit a hue shift. Pretty much like our in game samples.

118. GT Tonemap
Simple is best.
In the case of 709 output, the Rec2020 to 709 rewrite is possible.

120. SDR users are important
Most tvs are still SDR
HDR tvs are in the minority
In either case we want a good picture.

121. The GT Tonmap lets us reasonably parameterize for a lot of TVs with a single
curve. The same mid curve applies to SDR and HDR, giving both a qualitative 
similarity.

122-123. Graph of a 100 nit monitor response, no output above 100 nits.
A 250 nit output gives us a bit more brightness
A 1000 nit monitor gives us wide dynamic range

124. We're going to get a best possible result for SDR, and additional brightness
for HDR.

125. How do we qualify best?
- brightness scaling
- looks good on most tvs
- 5x dynamic range, can utilize DCI-P3 displays

- brighter than a 2.5x range
- It's similar to the Naughty Dog curve, with a 2.5x range in the linear section

126-128. SDR darker? HDR brighter?
- GTSport tries to balance shadow in SDR
- Increasing brightness in HDR reduces dynamic range
- blacks and whites are controlled
- SDR is bright enough

The result is a balance between HDR and SDR

129. Color grading
GTSport uses a lut
The lut is authored in the Rec.2020 PQ space
SDR is achieved from the Rec.2020 PQ via a mapping
It's applied simultaneously with the tone map relative to a midpoint
It's hard to explain with words...

130-131. Post Effects
The post effects are applied whether SDR or HDR
Different parameters are required for HDR and SDR
energy distribution is different
all kinds of parameters like for the lens are different

132. Movies
Movies are encoding in Rec.2020 linear for both SDR/HDR
The GT tonemap is applied. 

133. It was really hard to get the same image on different tvs.

134. Summary
We made an easy to use tone map
it worked with a lut

135, wide gamut high dynamic range

136. Car materials
Full spectral response fitted to a BRDF
using these steps
1. Samples obtained in the CIE1931 XYZ space
2. samples fitted to a BRDF
3. enough samples to minimize color error, parameter tweaking

Colors in CIE E00
Lighting for BT.2020 space, D65 whitepoint

137. Shows a sample plot, refer to "Toward Efficient Acquisition of BRDFs with
Fewer Samples" to learn more.

138. Shows (upper) aquisition, (lower) rendering through BRDF

139. Other assets are run through Scapes
Backgrounds are bracketed photography, 3ev 7 ~ 2ev 12, roughly
Panoramas are 4k bracketed RAW
Self generated HDR from engine

140. Base is Paul Debevec's hdr technique
Camera sensor calibration is according to Mitsunaga99
Panorama stitching happens at the same time as HDR conforming

141-142. See Debevec 97
143. Naively applying Debevec yields artifacts
It emphasizes noise
heavy denoising is required
144. Different camera RAW formats have their own color space
Sensor characteristics have to be taken into account

145-150 color charts were scanned to characterize response, under sunlight and
LED lighting. Sensor response is pretty huge, JPEG gamut is a crying shame

151. We store images in Radiance HDR. We stored color space meta data in a 
sidecar file, we named hdrmix. Tools and viewers had to open these files.
Loading HDR files into Photoshop didn't seem to give us what we wanted.
Exporting from Photoshop requires OpenEXR, and was a PITA.

152. Scapes translated to JPEG XR.
Rec.2020 color space, roughly
The pixel format was Half or RGBE.
We encoded and decoded from a proprietary format
6000x4000 decode took less than 3 seconds, and the image requires lesss than 7MB

153. Tracks and Menus
- there was a lot of Rec709 data to convert
- we had to watch out for texture banding
- ideally creation done in rec2020
- lighting in rec2020
- cars in rec2020
- we got rich colors
- Menu assets were provided in rec709 and required conversion

154-155 Future work and conclusions
- not many HDR monitors we can give to artists
- TVs are way too big and don't have good color accuracy
...
- there's a lot of work to do, anyone willing to help?

156. We introduced GTSport's HDR technology
HDR displays look pretty attractive
If you have a chance to look at the game in HDR please do
Art should be approached from an HDR first perspective, good looking SDR follows

157. Questions, contact, copyright

158. Aces ODT sample
ACES ODT is not paramteric. It's designed to accomodate a wide variety of TVs.
That sounds good I suppose.

ACES RRT is full of hard to use magic numbers. Not clear how to apply it to our
cars.

160. Typical result, there's a lot of color information before tonemapping, and
after mapping it doesn't look awesome.

161. RGB tone maps vs Yxy tonemaps
